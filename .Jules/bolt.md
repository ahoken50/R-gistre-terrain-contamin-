## 2024-05-24 - Pre-calculation of Expensive Computations
**Learning:** Functions like `normalizeAddress` that use multiple regex replacements are expensive when run inside loops (e.g., during validation or filtering). Pre-calculating these values during the initial data load (using `preprocessGovernmentData`) and storing them in non-enumerable properties (`_normalized_addr`) significantly reduces CPU usage during interactive tasks like validation, which triggers re-evaluation of the entire dataset.
**Action:** Identify expensive property derivations that are constant for a given record and move them to the preprocessing step. Use `Object.defineProperty({ enumerable: false })` to store them without affecting serialization.
